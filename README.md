# *ARITHMETIC PROGRESSION TERM FINDER*

### This application finds the nth term in an Arithmetic Progression using the formula (tn = a+(n-1)d)

In this equation, 'a' represents the first term in the A.P., or the 't1'

'd' represents the common difference, (t2-t1)

and 'n' represents the number of term.
